# Eat-Da-Burger-Sequelize

This simple application is an updated version of a previous one that I had done. It utilizes Sequelize to store burger information and track whether the burger has been devoured or not.
A user will enter in a burger name and push it to the database and print it on the left side of the screen. Once the burger has been devoured it is moved to the right hand side of the screen.
